# PulseBlasterUSB-Driver
This is a python wrapper around the SpinApi wrapper used to make working with the PulseBlasterUSB system easier. It optimizes and groups pulse sequences and allows the user to work in a higher level then the sometimes confusing form of the provided wrapper. This was written entirely by me with no affiliation to the Spincore Technologies company.
